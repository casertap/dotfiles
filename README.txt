With bufexplorer, you can quickly and easily switch between buffers by using the one of the default public interfaces (leader):
'be' (normal open) or 'bt' (toggle open / close) or 'bs' (force horizontal split open) or 'bv' (force vertical split open)

Moving windows:
Starting with this:

____________________
| one       | two  |
|           |      |
|           |______|
|           | three|
|           |      |
|___________|______|
Make 'three' the active window, then issue the command ctrl-w J. This moves the current window to fill the bottom of the screen, leaving you with:

____________________
| one       | two  |
|           |      |
|___________|______|
| three            |
|                  |
|__________________|
Now make either 'one' or 'two' the active window, then issue the command ctrl-w r. This 'rotates' the windows in the current row, leaving you with:

____________________
| two       | one  |
|           |      |
|___________|______|
| three            |
|                  |
|__________________|
Now make 'two' the active window, and issue the command ctrl-w H. This moves the current window to fill the left of the screen, leaving you with:

____________________
| two       | one  |
|           |      |
|           |______|
|           | three|
|           |      |
|___________|______|
As you can see, the manouevre is a bit of a shuffle. With 3 windows, it's a bit like one of those 'tile game' puzzles. I don't recommand trying this if you have 4 or more windows - you'd be better off closing them then opening them again in the desired positions.

---from vim to tmux (vim-slime)

select region and:
xmap <c-c><c-c> <Plug>SlimeRegionSend
nmap <c-c><c-c> <Plug>SlimeParagraphSend
nmap <c-c>v     <Plug>SlimeConfig

:SlimeConfig -> default, pane_number

SPACEMACS COLORS

First I had to uninstall my previous version of emacs and then install the patched version.

brew uninstall emacs
brew tap choppsv1/term24
brew install choppsv1/term24/emacs

Also for anyone interested this is a fast way to install the nightly version of iTerm2. By default casks will install to ~/Applications. Run install with --appdir if you want it elsewhere. Cask usage

brew tap caskroom/versions
brew cask install iterm2-nightly

Then run emacs with the flag mentioned here.

ITERM_24BIT=1 emacs

The last thing I need to figure out is how to fix the bad characters at the bottom. I have iTerm set to use Source Code Pro for both the ASCII and non ASCII font.

Other minor things not working for me:
The cursor is not colored like in GUI emacs.
There is no highlight on mouseover for clickable items.
